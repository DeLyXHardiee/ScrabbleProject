We have only completed the mandatory part of the assignment, but we do also use our own dictionary.

Our bot can play a full game with itself, but does sometimes get stuck in certain situations where it is unable to determine a valid move. It will then change pieces until it is no longer allowed to do so, then the game will terminate.
 
Here are some stats from running the bot 10 times
