# ScrabbleProject

Red assignments we need to make before starting:

- Assignment 2 (putting square functions together)
- Assignment 3 (checking for odd consonants, not sure if relevant?)
- Assignment 4 (making a gaddag?)
- Assignment 6 (modelling the Scrabble board, very relevant)
- Assignment 7 (all of the parsing!)
